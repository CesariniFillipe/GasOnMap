    To get one, follow this link, follow the directions and press "Create" at the end:

    You can also add your credentials to an existing key, using this line:
    CE:C7:02:36:EE:99:96:40:B9:C6:B4:C4:F9:D4:F0:A7:05:B7:43:1C;com.toninho.gasonmap

    Alternatively, follow the directions here:

    Once you have your key (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.
